The sequence files in this directory are fasta-formatted alignments
of "mosaic" sequences designed as candidate vaccine antigens by the
genetic algorithm described in the following manuscript

Each file contains several sets of sequences; each set is designed
for maximal 9-mer coverage of HIV-1 sequences in a particular
phylogenetic subset of HIV-1 (B-clade, C-clade, or M group).
Nomenclature is as follows:

GENE-clade-syn#.#

e.g., POL-B.syn4.2 is the second sequence of a 4-sequence mosaic
covering B-clade Pol sequences.  The sets of mosaics are separated
from each other by a single blank line. 

EACH SET IS TO BE USED TOGETHER -- e.g. the 6 sequences "nef_coreC.syn6.1"
through "nef_coreC.syn6.6" should neither be split apart from each
other nor used with other sequences.
